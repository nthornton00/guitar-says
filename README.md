# Guitar-Says
Inspired by the games “Simon Says” and “Guitar Hero,” this project, "Guitar Says," aimed to design an interactive game for enhancing memorization skills by replicating sequences to classic tunes.
This project will allow the user to select one of three pre-programmed songs from an LCD screen, prompt the user to replicate a section of a melody and output a score based on the user’s performance.
Each song has the following level of difficulty: “Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star” easy, “Happy Birthday” medium, “Star-Spangled Banner” hard. This project uses a unique hardware setup comprised of 
a Nucleo F401RE board, LCD display, shift register, Piezo buzzer, potentiometer, four LEDs, four buttons, two breadboards, Four 100 ohm resistors, and Five 330 ohm resistors. All code was written using Mbed Studio.
The necessary files to run this program are the main.cpp, NHD_0216HZ.cpp, and NHD_0216HZ.h files.
